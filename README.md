# Tic Tac Go

## Prerequisites

You must have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed.

## Running Program

```
./bin/app_start
```

## Developing

```
./bin/app_start bash
```

This will create a volume from src/ to /usr/src/app in the container, so developers can update the files locally and have them synced to the container.
